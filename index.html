    <h2 style="color: azure; text-align: center;">Tell me about yoursef</h2>
    <p style="color:antiquewhite;">To My Unhappy Self,

        Life isn’t always easy and I guess you don’t always get your way, no matter how hard you try and no matter how
        hard you believed in it. You really thought you had it all figured out until you realize you hadn’t. So maybe
        you took a left when you should have taken a right? Big deal, then! So what do you want to do now? Be miserable
        for a while, that’s okay. In fact, it’s probably healthier to go down this road. Bruise and hurt and question
        everything, and once you’re done, just get back up and rolling again.

        Another day is another chance to make it right. To fix all these things you consider as utterly wrong and to
        make it all better and nicer.

        You are luckier than you think so never stop being grateful. You do know that you are blessed, sometimes beyond
        measure, and you always keep somewhere in the back of your mind that little voice that whispers how life could
        be way worst. But there are the dark days. You know the days when you decide to just hate everything about you,
        and your life, and the entire universe around you. The bad days when you think that life is nothing but
        miserable simply because things didn’t go as you planned them to; simply because life has played a trick on you.

        But you know better. You’ve seen so much and learned so much already. You’ve loved way too hard at times and
        lost people you cared about way too soon. But honey, between you and me, you’ve been broken so many times that
        there’s no other option for you but to stand back up and keep moving forward. Sometimes you’ve clang on to
        things and situations and people you should have let go of but hey, you’ve learned something along the way.

        So if there’s a day – and oh we know there will be – when you just feel like hating yourself and your life and
        the whole universe around, please just pause for a second and stay still. I hope you’ll take that time out to
        reminisce some good about you (not just what makes you unhappy) and the things that make your life and all you
        are. I hope you’ll take the chance to look beneath the layers of dirt you’ve decided to cover yourself up with.
        I hope you’ll see the good in you hidden down there. And as you do this, remember that you deserve kindness,
        love and respect and stop acting like you had to lower your standards to match up someone else’s will. I know
        there will be people you’ll be afraid to lose and you’ll want them to love you back but keep in mind that love
        cannot be forced. Remember that everything happens for a reason; the signs are here for a reason. I know
        sometimes it just hurts too much to face the truth and you rather look the other way for a while but that’s
        okay. You’re strong so I know you won’t stay sidetracked for too long and in the end, you’ll do what’s best for
        you.

        And though it can be real hard at times to go through life with that hole within that makes you unhappy, please
        don’t despair. You are loved by the right people so don’t worry and stay the way you are. Remain open to love,
        positive energies, and to life. Don’t try to force things too much. They will come into your life naturally and
        for the best outcome.

        So keep working hard, never give up on what you believe in and keep trying to be your best self.

        Oh and don’t forget to smile and stay positive because seriously babe, you spend way too much time looking
        miserable. Always let love and light in even on the darkest days. Always rise above the negative and if you ever
        come to doubt of your own worth or if your heart bruises too much because of something or someone, remember
        something good about yourself. You can’t be that bad.

        You are loveable and I’ve got a feeling you won’t stop there. Greater things and better days are coming your way
        so keep holding on.

        And not matter what, always remember your luck and all the love you have in you.

        You matter.</p>
